      <p>Dive Overlay Generator is a free tool designed for scuba divers who want to create beautiful visual summaries of their dives.</p>
      <p>This web app converts Shearwater dive log files (.csv format) into shareable overlay images that highlight depth, dive time, water temperature, and more.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a recreational diver or a technical diver, this tool allows you to present your dive profile in a stylish format suitable for posting on social media or saving in your personal logbook.</p>
      <p>We built this platform with simplicity and privacy in mindâ€”your data is never uploaded to a server, and everything is processed in your browser.</p>
      <p>This project is maintained by a team of passionate divers and developers, and it's completely free to use.</p>
      <p>We are continuously working on supporting more formats from other dive computer brands in the near future.</p>
      <p>If you enjoy using this tool, consider sharing it with your dive buddies and community.</p>
